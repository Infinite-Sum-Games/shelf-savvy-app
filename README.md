# Shelf Savvy (Mobile App)

# Pitch
Shelf-Savvy is a mobile application designed to combat food waste and foster a 
community of responsible food consumers. The app empowers users to:

*1. Track Food Inventory*
     Users can easily input and track the food items they have at home

*2. Prevent Food Waste:*
    Users can receive "Use It Up" recipes based on their available inventory 
    to help them use up food before it goes bad. The app will suggest creative 
    ways to repurpose leftovers and avoid throwing away perfectly edible food.

*3. Donate Excess Food:*
    Users can easily connect with local food banks and charities through the app.
    They can schedule food donations and track their contributions.

*4. Earn Incentives and Recognition:*
    Users earn points for various actions, such as tracking food daily, 
    utilizing recipes to prevent waste, and donating food to food-banks.
    Points can be redeemed for discounts at local grocery stores or used to 
    support charitable causes.

*5. Engage with a Community:*
    The app features a leaderboard showcasing the top users who have 
    contributed most to reducing food waste and supporting their community.
    Users can connect with other community members, share tips and recipes, 
    and participate in community challenges.
